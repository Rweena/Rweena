## Hi there 👋

I'm Rweena, a Software Engineer with a passion for building clean, scalable systems and solving real world problems through code.

My work spans across frontend development.

This GitHub is a collection of what I built. Some of it’s polished, some of it’s in progress, but all of it reflects how I think and grow as a developer.

Feel free to explore the repos, and don’t hesitate to reach out.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a few frontend projects
- 🌱 I’m currently learning fullstack web development
- 📫 How to reach me: my accounts are under my bio
